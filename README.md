# High Power 445nm Laser Rifle

This project is my private weekend project which aims to create a high power portable laser rifle.
I'm not the first dipshit to come up with the idea of a Laser Rifle, Styro Pyro has been doing this
much longer than I have, but I figured I would give a shot at doing it better. :3

That's correct, the original idea was for it to be a wrist gauntlet, but considering that I want to add an auto focusing
lens with LIDAR range finding, it was more appropriate to make this into a rifle instead. This project would be way to bulky
for a wrist laser.

# Device Operation

As of right now, the 126 Watt Laser Rifle is successfully operating at full power, which means that
the device is outputting a fair amount of heat.

The device is easily able to cut through cardboard, wood, and even metal when focused into a central point.
